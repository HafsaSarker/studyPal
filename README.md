### Study Pal 
    A mini quizlet app (because quizlet is my favorite tool for studying :P) 

#### What I learned
- [x] Utilizing JWT to authenticate users 
- [x] Protecting routes using auth middleware
- [x] MongoDB to store user information as well as their study sets they create 
- [x] Toast to send cute-ish alerts such as when a user creates a study set
- [x] Using Redux to handle states (kind of)
- [x] Node/Express to serve application
- [x] REST api
